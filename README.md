# RTFM-2

This is part 2 of the RTFM Firebase project. In this project we'll walk through adding Authentication to your application.

Since a large part of learning to program is getting used to reading documentation as well as learning to read other people's code, this project will be a little less hand holdy than usual.

There will be two main steps to this project. Adding Authentication functionality to our UserService service and then when our Route changes checking our UserService to see if the user is authenticated.

[HERE](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/FirebaseLogin) is a sample application which demonstrates both principles as well as demonstrating how to register as a user with Firebase. I'd recommend cloning this project, throwing in a bunch of ```debugger``` statements and try to figure out what's going on.

The task for this morning is to walk through this tutorial until you feel comfortable with what's going on, then adding the same functionality to the RTFM project you built yesterday. This will be challenging, but it will be extremely rewarding and beneficial if you're able to do it. Odds are in a technical interview you'll be sat down in front of someone else's code and you have to explain what's going on, this will get you practice with that.
